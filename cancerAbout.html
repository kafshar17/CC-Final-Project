	<h3>Our Goal</h3>
		<p>Following a cancer diagnosis, patients and their families might have questions about the many resources available to support themselves and their families. We strive to connect patients with free services to better ease the emotional, physical, spiritual or social challenges that one might face while receiving treatment.</p>

	<h3>Who We Are</h3>
		<p>This website was created by four high shcool girls during their Girls Who Code Summer Imersion Program at Electronic Arts. </p>
